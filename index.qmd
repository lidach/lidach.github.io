# About

I am a Research Associate (Postdoc) at Quantitative Fisheries Center ([QFC](https://www.canr.msu.edu/qfc/)) & Michigan State University. I consider myself a quantitative fisheries ecologist. Some of my research interests and expertise include stock assessment, simulation modeling, fish population dynamics, socio-ecological modeling, management strategy evaluation, and assessment of harvest regulations.
