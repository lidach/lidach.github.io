    "title": "Examining the performance of alternative harvest regulations for short-lived taxa: A case study of Florida Bay scallop management",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Authors: Lisa Chong* (UF), Nicholas Fisch* (NOAA), John Scott Borsum (UF), Jennifer Granneman (FWC), Diana Perry (UF), Gabrielle Love (UF), Brittany Hall-Scharf (FL SeaGrant), Robert Botta (UF), Kai Lorenzen (UF), Edward Camp (UF), Zachary Siders (UF)\n*shared first authorship\nIn this manuscript we explore the performance of current and alternative management regulations for a simulated recreational bay scallop fishery on the Gulf coast of Florida. The bay scallop recreational fishery in Florida offers an interesting case study on the management of short lived and semelparous taxa, a group of species whose unique life history may render classical fisheries management tools or regulations suboptimal. We first develop a simulation model representing a local Florida bay scallop fishery and use this model to evaluate alternative management regulations under various levels of exploitation and effort.\n\n\n\nMap of Big Bend region of Florida (red rectangle in inset) depicting the five scalloping zones (A-E). Zone D (depicted in orange) was the area chosen for the baseline management regulations in this study and spans Levy, Citrus, and Hernando counties. The per person bag limit in gallons of whole scallops as well as the dates for the open and close of the scalloping season are provided in the table by zone. Note that zone C has a rolling bag limit that is 50% lower in the first 15 day of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\nResults of spawning output relative to unfished for the different management regulations simulated in this study under different starting levels of population exploitation (columns) and different assumptions about the level of effort expended between years (rows). The first row depicts a scenario with constant effort in each year of the simulation, where the second row depicts a scenario with effort doubling over the course of the 25-year simulation period.\n\n\nOur findings suggest that biologically designed regulations (e.g. later season or rolling bag limits), that ensured some bay scallop spawning prior to harvest, performed well across all simulated exploitation and effort levels on both ecological and socioeconomic metrics. Under greater simulated exploitation, these regulations clearly outperformed other regulations, but also performed no worse than other regulations under lower exploitation simulations.\nNow published: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783623000760\nCode and workflow: https://github.com/lidach/CampLabScallop"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Authors: Lisa Chong (ZMT), Tobias Mildenberger (DTU), Merrill Rudd (UW), Marc Taylor (Thünen), Jason Cope (NWFSC), Trevor Branch (UW), Matthias Wolff (ZMT), Moritz Stäbler (ZMT)\n\n\n\nphoto credit: Tobias Mildenberger\n\n\nOne of the hardest problems in fisheries is to assess the status of fisheries that are data poor or limited. Numerous data-limited length-based methodologies have been developed and applied to report on the regional status of fisheries across many stocks, including Thompson and Bell (TB), length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR), length-based integrated mixed effects (LIME), and length-based risk analysis (LBRA). While all four methods use length-data as a primary input, estimates of stock status might vary due to differing model assumptions. The performance of these methods needs to be tested to determine which are the most accurate in different circumstances.\nWe tested these models by simulating large populations of individual fish, running the models, and then comparing the model estimates against the actual status in the simulations. This individual-based modelling approach allowed the authors to track individuals in populations rather than using an approximation of lengths distributed by age, thus adding a unique level of independence in the operating model.\n\n\n\nViolin plots of relative error for spawning potential ratio (SPR) for three life histories (short-, medium-, and longer-lived), three exploitation levels (target, under-, and overexploited), and three recruitments (no error, stochastic error, and autocorrelation pattern and error). Four methods (length-based Thompson and Bell (TB, in orange), length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR, in green), length-based integrated mixed effects (LIME, in blue), and length-based risk analysis (LBRA, in violet)) were analysed. The grey horizontal line is the zero relative error line, and the black dot is the median relative error indicating bias. Each plot has a different y-axis with a smoother tail.\n\n\nThe results revealed the biases and imprecision of each method under various life history, exploitation, and recruitment scenarios. All methods have difficulties assessing short-lived species and are less accurate when analyzing severely overexploited and underexploited stocks. Increased recruitment error does increase imprecision but can decrease bias. If trends in population status and the stock recruitment relationship are unknown, the authors recommend using TB and LBSPR since both methods performed best across all scenarios.\nThis study highlights the importance of testing stock assessment methods against alternative model assumptions in order to better quantify their performance and to identify their strengths and weaknesses under various situations.\nNow published: https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsz212"
