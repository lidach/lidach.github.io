    "text": "Authors: Lisa Chong (ZMT), Tobias Mildenberger (DTU), Merrill Rudd (UW), Marc Taylor (Thünen), Jason Cope (NWFSC), Trevor Branch (UW), Matthias Wolff (ZMT), Moritz Stäbler (ZMT)\n\n\n\nphoto credit: Tobias Mildenberger\n\n\nOne of the hardest problems in fisheries is to assess the status of fisheries that are data poor or limited. Numerous data-limited length-based methodologies have been developed and applied to report on the regional status of fisheries across many stocks, including Thompson and Bell (TB), length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR), length-based integrated mixed effects (LIME), and length-based risk analysis (LBRA). While all four methods use length-data as a primary input, estimates of stock status might vary due to differing model assumptions. The performance of these methods needs to be tested to determine which are the most accurate in different circumstances.\nWe tested these models by simulating large populations of individual fish, running the models, and then comparing the model estimates against the actual status in the simulations. This individual-based modelling approach allowed the authors to track individuals in populations rather than using an approximation of lengths distributed by age, thus adding a unique level of independence in the operating model.\n\n\n\nViolin plots of relative error for spawning potential ratio (SPR) for three life histories (short-, medium-, and longer-lived), three exploitation levels (target, under-, and overexploited), and three recruitments (no error, stochastic error, and autocorrelation pattern and error). Four methods (length-based Thompson and Bell (TB, in orange), length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR, in green), length-based integrated mixed effects (LIME, in blue), and length-based risk analysis (LBRA, in violet)) were analysed. The grey horizontal line is the zero relative error line, and the black dot is the median relative error indicating bias. Each plot has a different y-axis with a smoother tail.\n\n\nThe results revealed the biases and imprecision of each method under various life history, exploitation, and recruitment scenarios. All methods have difficulties assessing short-lived species and are less accurate when analyzing severely overexploited and underexploited stocks. Increased recruitment error does increase imprecision but can decrease bias. If trends in population status and the stock recruitment relationship are unknown, the authors recommend using TB and LBSPR since both methods performed best across all scenarios.\nThis study highlights the importance of testing stock assessment methods against alternative model assumptions in order to better quantify their performance and to identify their strengths and weaknesses under various situations.\nNow published: https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsz212"

The bay scallop recreational fishery in Florida offers an interesting case study on the management of short lived and semelparous taxa, a group of species whose unique life history may render classical fisheries management tools or regulations suboptimal. We first develop a simulation model representing a local Florida bay scallop fishery and use this model to evaluate alternative management regulations under various levels of exploitation and effort.\n\n\n\nMap of Big Bend region of Florida (red rectangle in inset) depicting the five scalloping zones (A-E). Zone D (depicted in orange) was the area chosen for the baseline management regulations in this study and spans Levy, Citrus, and Hernando counties. The per person bag limit in gallons of whole scallops as well as the dates for the open and close of the scalloping season are provided in the table by zone. Note that zone C has a rolling bag limit that is 50% lower in the first 15 day of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\nResults of spawning output relative to unfished for the different management regulations simulated in this study under different starting levels of population exploitation (columns) and different assumptions about the level of effort expended between years (rows). The first row depicts a scenario with constant effort in each year of the simulation, where the second row depicts a scenario with effort doubling over the course of the 25-year simulation period.\n\n\nOur findings suggest that biologically designed regulations (e.g. later season or rolling bag limits), that ensured some bay scallop spawning prior to harvest, performed well across all simulated exploitation and effort levels on both ecological and socioeconomic metrics. Under greater simulated exploitation, these regulations clearly outperformed other regulations, but also performed no worse than other regulations under lower exploitation simulations.\nNow published: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783623000760\nCode and workflow: https://github.com/lidach/CampLabScallop"

Artificial reefs are known to affect fish, fishers, surrounding habitat, and management; however, this has not been examined holistically as their feedbacks are difficult to intuit. Given the natural of widespread introduction of made-made structures to the seascape, it is likely that artificial reefs have local and systems-level effects on fisheries. This should be examined in the socioecological systems context as the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of artificial reefs do not exist in isolation.\nWe conducted a literature review to catalogue effects and feedbacks of artificial reefs on social-ecological fisheries systems and recreational fisheries. We extracted information from both artificial reef and recreational fisheries research. This synthesis reveals that artificial reefs across the world may result in a net negative effect on fisheries as socioeconomic benefits outweigh the biological benefits and productivity. There may be unintended consequences if biological benefits from habitat-to-fish and fish-to-fish feedbacks are outweighed by population losses due to greater socioeconomic benefits from fish-to-fisher feedbacks. Taken in concert with their semi-permanent nature and apparent popularity with stakeholders, a view emerges of artificial reefs possibly functioning as a “social-ecological trap”. We also highlighted important effects of artificial reefs on fisheries and linkages that need to be accounted for when considering their deployment.\n\n\n\nSummary figure of the components of a social-ecological system with artificial reefs. The main components are fish, fisher, habitat and managers, of which are affected by the deployment of artificial reefs. We define “managers” as someone responsible for overseeing the management and conservation of resources, including fish populations, fishers, and their habitats. The direct effects (regular text), indirect effects (italicized text), and direct and indirect effects (italicized and bolded text) are shown with the black arrow. The feedbacks (blue text) are shown with the dotted blue arrow, which include (1) fish-to-fish, (2) habitat-to-fish, (3) fish-to-fisher, and (4) habitat-to-fish-to-fishers-to-manager."

These are developed in support of Extension program area goals and objectives and published by UF/IFAS academic departments.\n\nArtificial reefs in Florida 101\nAuthors: Lisa Chong (Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences), Angela Collins (Florida SeaGrant), Holly Abeels (Florida SeaGrant), Anna Braswell (Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences), Ana Zangroniz (Florida SeaGrant), Andrew Ropicki (Food and Resource Economics Department), Scott Jackson (Florida SeaGrant), and Edward Camp (Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences)\nThis four-part series provides an overview of Florida’s artificial reefs for decision-makers, such as local government officials, management agency personnel, artificial reef manufacturers, and extension agents. The publications describe, summarize, and explain scientific information about artifical reefs and break up the topics for easy reading and comprehension.\n\n\n\nThe reasons why artificial reefs are built. Artificial reefs are typically built to increase habitat and recreational opportunities, which can help fish populations by affecting vital demographic rates of growth, reproduction, and/or survival and by providing food and shelter. Scientists conduct research on these topics to gain a better understanding of the impacts of artificial reefs\n\n\nPart 1 describes why artifical reefs are built in Florida. It serves as a primer for the rest of the series.\nPart 2 explains how artificial reefs affect fish ecology. This describes how artificial reefs affect ecological processes and how those changes may translate into species population-level effects.\nPart 3 conveys how artificial reefs affect end-users, which an emphasis on fishers and recreational divers. Artificial reefs can affect behavior by fishers and divers, which include choosing where, how much, and which species to target when fishing.\nPart 4 describes how the overall fishery system (fish, fishers, and divers) are affected by artificial reefs. It builds off information from the previous publications and goes into the trade-offs and benefits of artificial reefs.\n\n\nOverview and updates of artificial reefs in Florida\nArtificial Reefs and People: how we create them and how they affect us: This is an overview of how people are involved with artificial reefs. Artificial reefs affect users, local economies, government, state scientists, and managers.\n\n\n\nProcess of artificial reef implementation in Florida. This figure depicts the interaction among stakeholders and primary users and shows how their influences affect the implementation of artificial reefs.\n\n\nAn update on Florida’s artificial reefs: recent deployments and trends: This reviews artificial reef deployments from 2015-2021 by region.\n\n\n\nFlorida’s artificial reefs, overall and since 2015, by region. The different colored counties show the different regions of the state, and the open circles show artificial reef locations. Black circles show reefs deployed prior to 2015, and red circles show those deployed 2015–2021. The thin blue line shows the outer extent of state waters (9 nautical miles on the Gulf coast and 3 nautical miles on the Atlantic coast), and the dashed line shows the outer extent of federal waters. Note that the symbols for artificial reef are not to scale; they are much larger than the actual reef footprints. Thus, while the figure seems to indicate near continuous coverage of artificial reefs along the Florida coastline, artificial reefs make up an exceedingly small proportion of the ocean floor adjacent to Florida.\n\n\nAn update on Florida’s artificial reefs: recent research and what it means for Florida: This summarizes peer reviewed publications on key topics in artificial reefs literature, including marine ecology, fisher behavior, design, and monitoring.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Michael Dickson"
